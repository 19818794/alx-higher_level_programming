# Python - Hello, World

The aim is to learn how to use the list, the differences and similarities between strings and lists, the most common methods of lists, and how to use them. Also, learn about tuples and how and when to use them. What are sequence, tuple packing, and unpacking? What is the del statement, and how to use it?

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.
