# Python - Hello, World

The aim is to learn about sets and their common methods for performing set operations, to understand when to use sets instead of lists, and to know how to iterate over a set. Additionally, the goal is to understand dictionaries and their usage compared to lists or sets, comprehend the concept of keys in dictionaries, and learn how to iterate over a dictionary. Finally, we aim to grasp the concept of lambda functions and their usage, as well as understand the purpose and functionality of the map, reduce, and filter functions.

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.
