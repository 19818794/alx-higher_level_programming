# Python - More Classes and Objects

The aim is to learn about what is OOP, a class, an object, an instance, an attribute, a self, a method, a property, a class attribute, a class method, and a static method.

Also, what is the difference between a class and an object or instance, between an attribute and a property in Python, and between an object attribute and a class attribute?

What are the special __init__, __str__, and __repr__ methods, how to use them, and the difference between them?

What are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes? How to bind attributes to objects and classes and how does Python find the attributes of an object or class?
