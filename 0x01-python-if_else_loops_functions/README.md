# Python - Hello, World

The aim is to learn about if/else, for, while, break, continue, and pass statemenets, and how to use functions.

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in Python and C:

| Filename                    | Description
|:---------------------------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `0-positive_or_negative.py` | prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
| `1-last_digit.py`           | prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
| `2-print_alphabet.py`       | prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
| `3-print_alphabt.py`        | prints the ASCII all the letters except q and e, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
| `4-print_hexa.py`           | prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
| `5-print_comb2.py`          | prints numbers from 0 to 99.
| `6-print_comb3.py`          | prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
| `7-islower.py`              | checks for lowercase characters.
| `8-uppercase.py`            | prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
| `9-print_last_digit.py`     | prints the last digit of a number.
| `10-add.py`                 | adds two integers and returns the result.
| `11-pow.py`                 | computes a to the power of b and returns the value.
| `12-fizzbuzz.py`            | prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except multiples of 3 print Fizz and of 5 Buzz, and of both FizzBuzz separated by a space.
| `13-insert_number.c`        | inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
| `lists.h`                   | a header file includes the prototypes of all functions, libraries, and structures used in task `13-insert_number.c`.
| `100-print_tebahpla.py`     | prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
| `101-remove_char_at.py`     | creates a copy of the string, removing the character at position n.
| `102-magic_calculation.py`  | a function does exactly the same as the proposed Python bytecode.
