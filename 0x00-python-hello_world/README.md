# Python - Hello, World

The aim is to learn about Python interpreting, printing text and variables, indexing and slicing strings, functions, and importing modules in Python.

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.
