# Python - Hello, World

The aim is to learn about Python interpreting, printing text and variables, indexing and slicing strings, functions, and importing modules in Python.

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in Python except `betty`:

| Filename                   | Description
|:--------------------------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `0-run`                    | a Shell script that runs a Python script.
| `1-run_inline`             | a Shell script that runs Python code.
| `2-print.py`               | prints exactly a string followed by a new line.
| `3-print_number.py`        | prints the integer stored in a variable, followed by a string, followed by a new line.
| `4-print_float.py`         | prints the float stored in a variable with a precision of 2 digits.
| `5-print_string.py`        | prints 3 times a string stored in a variable, followed by its first 9 characters.
| `6-concat.py`              | edites a string and prints it.
| `7-edges.py`               | utilizes indexing and slicing to print specific strings.
