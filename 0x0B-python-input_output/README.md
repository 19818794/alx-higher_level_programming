# Python - Input/Output

This project aims to learn how to open, write, read, and move the cursor in a file. What is JSON, serialization, deserialization, and how to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string and reverse?

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in Python:

| Filename                   | Description
|:--------------------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
| `0-read_file.py`           | reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.
| `1-write_file.py`          | writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.
| `2-append_write.py`        | appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.
| `3-to_json_string.py`      | returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
| `4-from_json_string.py`    | returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.
| `5-save_to_json_file.py`   | writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation.
| `6-load_from_json_file.py` | creates an Object from a "JSON file".
