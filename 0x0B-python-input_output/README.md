# Python - Input/Output

This project aims to learn how to open, write, read, and move the cursor in a file. What is JSON, serialization, deserialization, and how to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string and reverse?

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

All of the following files are programs written in Python:

| Filename                   | Description
|:--------------------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
| `0-read_file.py`           | reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.

| `2-append_write.py`        | appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.
