# Python - Hello, World

The aim is to learn how to import functions from another file, use imported functions, create a module, and use the built-in function dir(). How to prevent code in a script from being executed when imported, and how to use command line arguments with Python programs.

# Technologies

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Python Scripts are written with python3 (version 3.8.5).

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in Python:

| Filename                    | Description
|:---------------------------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `0-add.py`                  | imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
